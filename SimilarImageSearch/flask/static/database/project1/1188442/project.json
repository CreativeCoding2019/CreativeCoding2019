{"info": {"comment": "This project shows a person brainstorming about how to get ideas for their next scratch project. It uses the list blocks, which are in the variables category.  There is a list called \"ideas,\" which contains a lot of things for the boy to think about.  He chooses a new random item from the list to think each time.\n\nTry adding new things for him to think.  What other projects can you make where a word or sentence is picked randomly from a list? \n", "projectID": "", "flashVersion": "", "author": "0890397976", "userAgent": "", "spriteCount": 2, "scriptCount": 1, "videoOn": false, "hasCloudData": false}, "variables": [], "currentCostumeIndex": 0, "costumes": [{"baseLayerID": 0, "baseLayerMD5": "7bf2c989edd96edd9214f5db50da158e.jpg", "costumeName": "spotlight-stage", "bitmapResolution": 1, "rotationCenterX": 240, "rotationCenterY": 180}], "lists": [{"listName": "ideas", "isPersistent": false, "visible": false, "y": 59, "x": 36, "width": 120, "contents": ["I could try clicking on the surprise sprite button to see what I get", "I could ask a friend for ideas", "I could try editing one of the sample projects", "I could look around on the scratch web site for some interesting projects to remix", "I could find some images on the web and import them into scratch", "I could take some pictures of the world around me and make a tour in scratch", "I could make a project based on my favorite book, movie or game", "I could record some sounds and make an interactive musical instrument ", "I could shut my eyes and see what appears in my mind", "I could make a project about that crazy dream I had", "I could look around outside to see what inspires me in nature", "I could make a music video for my favorite song", "I could make some drawings on paper and see what ideas I get from those", "I could write a story and then animate it", "I could make a project about my name, where each letter is a sprite", "I could download a project from the scratch website and open it up to see how it works", "I could make a project for somebody I love", "I could go to the support page on the scratch website and look for ideas there", "I could play with the graphic effects blocks", "I could play with the pen blocks", "I could make a virtual pet", "I could play with the list blocks", "I could try making a scratch project that younger kids would enjoy", "I could try making a scratch project that a blind person could interact with", "I could make a project about a poem"], "height": 117}], "videoAlpha": 0.5, "tempoBPM": 60, "objName": "Stage", "scripts": [], "scriptComments": [], "sounds": [{"soundID": 0, "rate": 11025, "format": "", "sampleCount": 258, "soundName": "pop", "md5": "83a9787d4cb6f3b7632b4ddfebf74367.wav"}], "penLayerMD5": "279467d0d49e152706ed66539b577c00.png", "children": [{"direction": 90.0, "variables": [], "indexInLibrary": 1, "costumes": [{"baseLayerID": 1, "baseLayerMD5": "f0b0f530bdfccc66b0194677db99fdca.png", "costumeName": "dragon1-a", "bitmapResolution": 1, "rotationCenterX": 66, "rotationCenterY": 63}, {"baseLayerID": 2, "baseLayerMD5": "b582bd1ddaefb716644506253b0fb78c.png", "costumeName": "dragon1-b", "bitmapResolution": 1, "rotationCenterX": 90, "rotationCenterY": 58}, {"baseLayerID": 3, "baseLayerMD5": "f0b0f530bdfccc66b0194677db99fdca.png", "costumeName": "dragon1-a1", "bitmapResolution": 1, "rotationCenterX": 66, "rotationCenterY": 63}, {"baseLayerID": 4, "baseLayerMD5": "b582bd1ddaefb716644506253b0fb78c.png", "costumeName": "dragon1-b1", "bitmapResolution": 1, "rotationCenterX": 90, "rotationCenterY": 58}, {"baseLayerID": 5, "baseLayerMD5": "f0b0f530bdfccc66b0194677db99fdca.png", "costumeName": "dragon1-a2", "bitmapResolution": 1, "rotationCenterX": 66, "rotationCenterY": 63}], "lists": [], "visible": true, "rotationStyle": "leftRight", "currentCostumeIndex": 2, "scripts": [[22, 20.0, [["whenGreenFlag"], ["doForever", [["doRepeat", 10, [["forward:", 10], ["nextCostume"], ["bounceOffEdge"], ["wait:elapsed:from:", 0.2]]], ["think:duration:elapsed:from:", ["getLine:ofList:", 0, "ideas"], 5]]]]]], "sounds": [{"soundID": 1, "rate": 11025, "format": "", "sampleCount": 258, "soundName": "pop", "md5": "83a9787d4cb6f3b7632b4ddfebf74367.wav"}, {"soundID": 2, "rate": 22050, "format": "", "sampleCount": 0, "soundName": "meow", "md5": "e6404c6c17f948f93d737aa63ed8c18f.wav"}], "spriteInfo": {}, "scale": 1.0, "objName": "boy", "scriptComments": [], "scratchX": 0, "scratchY": 0, "isDraggable": true}, {"direction": 90.0, "variables": [], "indexInLibrary": 2, "costumes": [{"baseLayerID": 6, "baseLayerMD5": "1752740d6f9774ed896d3d63e09eaf46.png", "costumeName": "costume1", "bitmapResolution": 1, "rotationCenterX": 103, "rotationCenterY": 13}], "lists": [], "visible": true, "rotationStyle": "normal", "currentCostumeIndex": 0, "scripts": [], "sounds": [{"soundID": 3, "rate": 22050, "format": "", "sampleCount": 0, "soundName": "Doy-doy-doy", "md5": "e6404c6c17f948f93d737aa63ed8c18f.wav"}], "spriteInfo": {}, "scale": 1.0, "objName": "instructions", "scriptComments": [], "scratchX": 0, "scratchY": 0, "isDraggable": true}]}
